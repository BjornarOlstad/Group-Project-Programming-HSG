# Write your task code inside a function.
# The function should be named taskX(), where X is your task number (e.g., task1(), task2()).
# Use this structure for your code:

def task_3():

    print("Task Name: A descriptive name for your task.")
    
    # Place your code here.
    # Ensure the code runs independently within this function.
    
    
    print("Task completed successfully.\n")


# Donâ€™t worry about the menu or integrating with other tasks; just make sure your function works independently.
# Test your function in isolation to ensure it runs without errors. Then the main.py file will run the menu and import the function you made.
